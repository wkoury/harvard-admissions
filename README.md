# Description
Collaboration between Dr. Tyler Ransom and Will Koury.

A static web page that estimates a given high school senior's chances of being accepted to Harvard University.

https://wkoury.github.io/harvard-admissions/

* The purpose of this website is to inform interested parties about their likelihood of admission to Harvard University based on academic credentials, race/ethnicity, and special connections.
* The admissions statistics are based on Harvard admissions data from the Classes of 2014-2019 made public through the SFFA v. Harvard (2018) lawsuit. See below for specific references.
* Harvard employs a holistic admissions process, which means that there are many other factors than academics that determine your admissions chances.
* Holistic admissions are inherently random, so even the most academically qualified applicants may not have a large admissions probability.
* The designers of this website hope that you will use this information when deciding which colleges to apply to. Our primary motivation is providing information to the public.

Notes for those interested:
* These numbers officially come from [this research paper](https://tyleransom.github.io/research/legacyathlete.pdf) written by a trio of economists. Within that paper, we use Table 2 (p. 41) and Table 6, Panel B (p. 45) to construct our numbers.
